More random!

Perlin noise is slow, what if the game didn't use perlin noise or simplex noise at all during generation, and instead used the raw gradient values. Well it'd have weird blocky results like this does.

No more Perlin noise should slightly speed up worldgen by doing just that, it should be compatible with other worldgen mods, although all of them would be well weird in the same way this is. Messing with the smooth value ranges for a solely random experience. Please be aware that smooth ears and wildly different areas being nearby are kinda the point and that no there isn't any guarantee that this will be better than any other worldgen you currently have.
